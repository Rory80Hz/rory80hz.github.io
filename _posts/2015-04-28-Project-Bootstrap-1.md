This is the first part of a series of shared wisdom from [Kyle Thompson](http://kylethompson.co.uk/), [Rob Lazzurs](http://blog.lazzurs.net/) and I, based on our shared experience over the years of working on projects, and our most recent adventure together.

We have all worked on various flavours of projects, from Prince 2 captained waterslides to various degrees of success and failure to Agile™®© and agile projects, again to varying degrees of success and failure.

We are all three of us a combination of developer and [''architect"](http://blog.pengin.pro/architect/). With Rob bringing an Ops flavour to proceedings.

To that end, we decided to get together recently to discuss the things that worked and totally didn't on projects we have been involved in, and ran through some of the common mistakes we've seen over and over.

*Disclaimer: We are strong believers in User Need based requirements, evidence based decision making, and agility, so these posts are firmly aimed in this direction*

### Areas of Interest
Unusually, maybe, for a bunch of tech people, we have opinions (not so unusual) on not just the technical part of the process, but the entire process of getting from something a user needs, all the way from idea to delivered value in a production system. And not just the how, but the why and the where too.

#### Context - Understand the playing field
This is a big part of working in an agile fashion, as a tech person, you are not a technical island, constantly put upon by the waves of requirements and whim (although sometimes it may feel that way). To truly work as part of a cross-functional team, it is important you have all context available to you to guide decision making, and that you are engaging with everyone involved in the project.

#### Location - It's more than what you do
Another important aspect for consideration is where you work. Trust us, we have worked in some truly awful places. I once had the privilege of using a desk *pedestal* as a working location for a week in a highly secured building and elsewhere, found that if you spoke above a whisper you got "sssshed" by some reports manager.  Kyle Location, Rob Location.

There are a number of aspects to where you work that are really important to allowing a cross functional team to really work well together. We'll talk about some of our ideas.
