This is the first part of a series of shared wisdom from [Kyle Thompson](http://kylethompson.co.uk/), [Rob Lazzurs](http://blog.lazzurs.net/) and I, based on our shared experience over the years of working on projects, and our most recent adventures together.

We have all worked on various flavours of projects, from Prince 2 captained waterslides to various degrees of success and failure to Agile™®© and agile projects, again to varying degrees of success and failure.

We are all three of us a combination of developer and [''architect"](http://blog.pengin.pro/architect/). With Rob bringing an Ops flavour to proceedings.

To that end, we decided to get together recently to discuss the things that worked and totally didn't on projects we have been involved in, and ran through some of the common mistakes we've seen over the years.

*Disclaimer: We are strong believers in User Need based requirements, evidence based decision making, and agility, so these posts are firmly aimed in this direction*

### Areas of Interest
Unusually, maybe, for a bunch of tech people, we have opinions (not so unusual) on not just the technical part of the process, but the entire process of getting something a user needs, all the way from idea to delivered value in a production system. Not just the how, but the why and the where too.

Below are the areas that we will discuss in subsequent posts, with our own observations on some good plans, and anti-patterns.

#### Context - Understand the playing field

This is a big part of working in an agile fashion, as a tech person, you are not a technical island, constantly put upon by the waves of requirements and whim (although sometimes it may feel that way). 

To truly work as part of a cross-functional team, it is important you have all context available to you to guide you and your fellow team members decision making, and that you are engaging with everyone involved in the project.

#### Location - It's more than what you do

Another important aspect for consideration is where you work. Trust us, we have worked in some truly awful places. I once had the privilege of using a desk *pedestal* as a working location for a week in a highly secured building and elsewhere, found that if you spoke above a whisper you got "sssshed" by some reports manager.  Kyle Location, Rob Location.

There are a number of aspects to where you work that are really important to allowing a cross functional team to really work well together. We'll talk about some of our ideas.

#### People - Who does what when?

As of today, we tend to need people to work on things. Sadly, despite our best efforts we haven't quite gotten to the automated clone workforce we were promised in an episode of Tomorrows World. 

That being the case, it is important that you let people know what it is they are responsible for from the outset. Whilst everyone on a team is working towards the same goal, there are certain people that have very clear responsibilities.

#### From Idea to Value

Building a superb digital service isn't just about the deadly technology you use, in fact that is just one part of getting the right thing in place.

How do you communicate your decisions around how to meet the User Need?

How do you get from an idea for some user value to getting that built and ready for action? 

Also, crucially, how do you verify what you have done is a good idea or not?

#### Pipeline - Works on my machine...

Ah DevOps, so many have tried, many have failed, others have butchered the idea beyond recognition into Silos of ultimate rubbish. 

There are right and wrong ways to go from really awesome developer machine based demo to a real live scary production system.

#### Management

How best do you run these projects? We've seen some pretty weird stuff in our time. Waterfall inside waterfalls, agile projects where that meant they used Rally for functional requirements and that was it, chaos based crisis management projects and everything else in between.

The reality is however, that a good working relationship between management people and those on the ground 'doing' is essential. Depending on the environment and relationship with the customer, the work these guys do is essential to allowing the teams to work in the way they need.
