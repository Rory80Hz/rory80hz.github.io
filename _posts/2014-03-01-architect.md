## Context / Full Disclosure

Straight up, I spent a significant amount of time in my early years 'doing stuff', the term Architect wasn't even on my radar, the first time I encountered it was maybe 8 or 9 years a go, and i distinctly remember thinking at the time that it sounded a bit "weird".
<br/>
<br/>
By some miracle, in my early career, I managed to be involved in working on projects or teams where it was people that  "do things" with someone responsible guiding it, not separate from the team, but working alongside and steering the ship.
<br/>
<br/>
Since then, I have encountered it more and more in the wild, and my original opinion hasn't changed.
<br/>
<br/>
Usually, from what I could see, it was a means to implement a hierarchal organisational structure around people that do things. The apparent side effect of this was to take people away from doing things, and move them more towards thinking about doing things, and telling other people that think about thinking about doing things why they should do them and for how long and how much of the stuff they were thinking about doing they should do, as well as start making them think about how good other people that are doing things are doing and how they could be doing them better. All of this without actually *doing* anything in terms of building things.
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing it engendered was a sense in those below them on the ladder, that they were basically less empowered than those on the levels above, and in the worst cases found, in the instances where the level above was entirely manned by "ENTARPRAIZ ARCHITEKTS", people were actively demotivated, and unwilling to try to do things better, because, the tower commands it.
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, this is the sort of thing that is reflected on building sites, where the guys carrying the hods, laying cement and generally getting on with constructing things, view the hand waving, plan wielding, Le Chameau wellington boot wearing Architect with suspicion, and in the cases where plan does not meet reality, hostility.

## What is an Architect then?

A fine question...to answer that though, you need to ask what is Architecture...
<br/>
<br/>

> Well, it's the stuff in your implementation that isn't easy to change...

<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so given the above definition, what is an Architect...
<br/>
<br/>
Probably someone that can have that drone-esque view from 50,000 ft, the sort of person that can hook up some serious workflow diagrams, and some tastefully arranged UML component diagrams of really nice patterns and "things" like Application layers, and Data Access Layers....
<br/>
<br/>
Well no. Because drawing a bunch of boxes of things, whilst useful to get an idea of the lay of the land is great, the gap between reality and theory is far too great. Those little dots that look like ants from way up there, could actually be grenades ready to blow up in your face, so they need to do a bit more than that...
<br/>
<br/>
For example, what do I choose for point to point communication for my components, HTTP or Message Bus?, do we need automatic service discovery? Do I need a steroid fuelled, MIG jet buying, database? What file system should we use for storing documents? Should we use Sharepoint? (No), and so on....
<br/>
<br/>
What else?
<br/>
<br/>
Well it must be the type of person that can say, damn it, the chips are down, we're going to stick in an ESB, because that fits my reference architecture. They type of person that goes, this worked before and dammit it will clearly work again in this entirely different context.
<br/>
<br/>
Clearly not.
<br/>
<br/>
But they do need to be a decision maker...so, therefore, they should have VAST experience in every possible eventuality they may encounter when building a solution...and clearly, based on LinkedIn profiles, there are a lot of people with this, and they also have badass things like TOGAF Level AWESOME which levels up credibility levels no end...
<br/>
<br/>
No.
<br/>
<br/>
Because such a beast does not exist, the decision making part is, though, important...as is experience. But what is vital here, is not to be so arrogant as to believe that you are some hot shit, and you know everything there is to know, or to assume that an industry built around providing certification is any indication of competency (this can also be said for Agile(tm) certifications).
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so i've suggested what an architect isn't, and hinted at what they are, so let me present my view.

## My View

An Architect is someone with sufficient experience to make decisions and guide others in the right direction, balancing dogmatism and pragmatism, know that they don't know everything, understand that they have more they can learn, and above all else understand how they can use others experience and knowledge to guide their decision making.
<br/>
<br/>
What they *do* is guide teams, leverage their experience to harness the expertise of the other people they work with to adapt and improve a solution, and understand, and communicate the wider context in which problems are being solved, and how best to solve them.
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately this may result in decisions getting made on data stores, communication protocols, layers, message buses etc. but that is not the unit of work you deal with, you deal with people, to get the best out of them, to arrive at the finest possible solution you can.
<br/>
<br/>
For me, the ability to do this diminishes the further away you are from the people who share the work of building things on a daily basis. You need to be involved. You need to lift the bricks into place, you need to see when the square box, didn't fit into the round hole, and see the angle grinder techniques used to make that work....
<br/>
<br/>
Just because we use the term Architecture for the bits of the system that are difficult to change, and, of itself, it is a good word to describe that, it does not mean that one person is the Architect, because really, the role you are fulfilling is way more than that.
<br/>
<br/>
So, really, Architect is a shit word for that role...not sure quite what a good word for the role is though.
